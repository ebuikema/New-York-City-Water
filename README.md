# New-York-City-Water
This project features an Excel document and Power BI dashboards aimed at looking at the status of New York City water health and trying to determine which areas tend to be the biggest offenders.

To see my project in detail, download the uploaded files that I have provided.

The first direction I had when it came to this project was to clean the Excel spreadsheet that I downloaded. Formatting the spreadsheet as a table makes it easier to filter my results and analyze data from there.
My next task was cleaning the data. There were many blank rows in the document, which would have affected the results and graphs in each pivot table.
After cleaning and analyzing using pivot tables, my next objective was to upload the file to Power BI to create a dashboard.

Once my dataset was uploaded to Power BI, and I inserted graphs into the dashboard, I was disappointed
I thought I would find some groundbreaking discovery about areas of New York City with the most issues. But none of that. Just issues with places not submitting the correct paper work on time.
Even that didn't have a general area where it was present. Even filtered for the years.

While my dashboard will help one see violations based on geographical area, it doesn't display any major issues related to the quality of public drinking water.

Which I guess is a good problem to have.
